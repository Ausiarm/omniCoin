# WHAT'S IT ABOUT?: 
The idea behind omniCoin is to create a central repository for all things crypto for beginners wanting to start learning about crypto currency. It is a one stop shop for all you might need to know when getting started. With sections for finding out about how different crypto currencies fluctuate, guides on the different terminology used and then helpful links to outside resources. 

# THE TEAM:
Our team consisted of: 
Armstrong Ashton-Lewis
Edson Nascimento
Natalia Chamon
Benedicte Powell

The tasks for the project were delegated out amongst the team, Edson took care of the backend and building the code framework for our project, as well as many other little odd jobs and bug fixing. Armstrong handled the making of the logo, writing content for our project, modals for the project, presentation of the application, keeping morale high and like Edson, odd jobs here and there! Natalia and Benedicte shared the design side of the project picking colours and working together closely, on top of that Natalia also made the nav bar and a bunch of the HTML & CSS elements, initial wireframes and odd jobs as well. Benedicte did the HQ wireframes, CSS elements, small fixes of cleaning up elements around the application. 
Overall everyone contributed throughout and we worked cohesively as a team, being sure to use branches and pulling frequently from the main branch.
